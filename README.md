## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. **Download the Files:** Download the template files from the provided source or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **HTML Structure:** Open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor. This file serves as the main structure of your portfolio webpage. Customize the existing sections or add new ones to showcase your skills, projects, and personal information.

3. **CSS Styling:** Open the `styles.css` file to modify the styling of your portfolio webpage. Update the colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual elements to reflect your personal style and create a visually appealing design.

4. **JavaScript Functionality:** If you want to add interactive elements or dynamic functionality to your portfolio, open the `script.js` file. Use JavaScript to create animations, implement form validation, or add any other desired features.

5. **Media Files:** Replace the placeholder images and videos in the `img` and `video` folders with your own media files. Ensure that the file names in your HTML code match the actual file names.

6. **Customization:** Explore the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to customize various aspects of your portfolio webpage, such as the navigation menu, layout, typography, colors, and content. Add your personal information, skills, and project details to make it uniquely yours.

7. **Testing and Previewing:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to preview your portfolio webpage locally. Test its functionality, responsiveness, and visual appeal across different devices and screen sizes.

8. **Deployment:** Once you are satisfied with your portfolio webpage, deploy it to a web server or hosting platform of your choice. Ensure that all the necessary files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, are uploaded correctly.
